IMDB Sentiment Analysis is an NLP task that classifies movie reviews as positive or negative. Using the IMDB dataset of 50,000 labeled reviews, techniques like text preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF, embeddings), and machine/deep learning models (Logistic Regression) are applied to predict sentiment automatically.
